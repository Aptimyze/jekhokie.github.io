<div class="home">
    <h1 class="page-heading">Projects</h1>

    Links to some web-based projects for exploration. There are *MANY* more projects in my GitHub account, but
    these are intended to be quick links to the GitHub Pages rendering of the web-based applications in my
    GitHub account.

            <div class="post-meta">Feb 22, 2017</div>

            A representation of Conway's Game of Life using the Phaser.js HTML5 web framework. This is a very
            basic representation of animation and array patterns to further explore the Phaser.js framework.

            </h2>

            <div class="post-meta">Nov 22, 2016</div>

            A kids game built using the Phaser.js HTML5 web framework to teach children how to identify various
            shapes and colors. Game includes very basic functionality and is lacking some DRY concepts, but serves
            its purpose (entertaining the little one).

            </h2>

            <div class="post-meta">June 21, 2015</div>

            A web-based mortgage calculator intended to grow in functionality and performs monthly payments, total
            interest paid, an amortization schedule, etc. There are plenty of mortage calculators out there already,
            but this tool was intended to grow into a much larger project to allow predicting calculations such as
            "what if I made a one-time extra principal payment".
