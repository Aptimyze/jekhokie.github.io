Quick tutorial related to the setup and usage patterns of the
[AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) service.

### Background

The AWS Elastic Beanstalk service is a quick way to deploy web applications for almost any language/
framework available in a scalable infrastructure. The service provides web servers that are best
suited for the language and framework being developed (i.e. Apache, Nginx, Passenger, IIS) and
it automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, health monitoring, and
more. Cost of an Elastic Beanstalk application is only associated with the cost of the resources
used within the application (i.e. EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancer, etc).
